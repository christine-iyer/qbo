# Invoice Me - QuickBooks OAuth Invoice Application

A full-stack application for creating and managing invoices through QuickBooks Online integration with OAuth authentication.

### Production Deployment Guide - August 6, 2025

## üöÄ Moving from Sandbox to Production QuickBooks

### **1. QuickBooks Developer Account Setup**

**Current Status**: You're using sandbox mode  
**Production Steps**:
1. **Go to**: [QuickBooks Developer Portal](https://developer.intuit.com)
2. **Navigate to**: Your app dashboard
3. **Click**: "Go Live" or "Submit for Production"
4. **Complete**: App review process (can take 1-2 weeks)

### **2. App Review Requirements**

QuickBooks requires your app to meet these criteria:
- ‚úÖ **Functional OAuth flow** (you have this!)
- ‚úÖ **Proper error handling** (you have this!)
- ‚úÖ **Professional UI/UX** (you have this!)
- ‚úÖ **Security compliance** (HTTPS required for production)
- üìã **Privacy policy** (you'll need to create this)
- üìã **Terms of service** (you'll need to create this)

### **3. Code Changes for Production**

Update your `.env` file for production:
```env
# Production Environment
ENVIRONMENT=production
CLIENT_ID=your_production_client_id_here
CLIENT_SECRET=your_production_client_secret_here
REDIRECT_URI=https://yourapp.com/auth/callback  # Must use HTTPS
COMPANY_ID=  # This will be set dynamically per user

# React App Environment Variables
REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID=your_production_client_id_here
REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=production

# Email Configuration  
EMAIL_USER=your_business_email@yourdomain.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_app_password
```

Update your server.js to handle both sandbox and production:
```javascript
const getQuickBooksBaseURL = () => {
  return process.env.ENVIRONMENT === 'production' 
    ? 'https://quickbooks.api.intuit.com'      // Production
    : 'https://sandbox-quickbooks.api.intuit.com';  // Sandbox (current)
};

// Update all API calls to use the dynamic URL:
const response = await axios.get(
  `${getQuickBooksBaseURL()}/v3/company/${companyId}/query?query=SELECT * FROM Customer`
);
```

### **4. Environment Comparison**

| **Aspect** | **Sandbox (Current)** | **Production** |
|------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **URL** | `sandbox-quickbooks.api.intuit.com` | `quickbooks.api.intuit.com` |
| **Data** | Test/fake data | Real customer data |
| **Customers** | Limited test customers | Actual QuickBooks customers |
| **Invoices** | Test invoices | Real invoices with real money |
| **OAuth** | `appcenter.intuit.com/connect/oauth2` | Same (but with prod credentials) |
| **HTTPS** | Optional | **Required** |

### **5. Deployment Requirements**

**Backend Requirements**:
- **HTTPS**: SSL certificate required
- **Domain**: Real domain name (not localhost)
- **Server**: Cloud hosting (AWS, Heroku, DigitalOcean, etc.)

**Frontend Requirements**:
- **Static hosting**: Netlify, Vercel, or similar
- **HTTPS**: Also required for frontend
- **Environment variables**: Production API URLs

### **6. OAuth Redirect URI Update**

**Current**: `http://localhost:3001/auth/callback`  
**Production**: `https://yourdomain.com/auth/callback`

This must be updated in:
- Your QuickBooks Developer Console
- Your `.env` file
- Your React app configuration

### **7. Production Launch Steps**

1. **Deploy your app** to a production server with HTTPS
2. **Update QuickBooks app settings** with production URLs
3. **Submit for review** in QuickBooks Developer Console
4. **Wait for approval** (1-2 weeks typically)
5. **Test with real QuickBooks data** (start with your own account)
6. **Launch to customers**

### **8. Multi-Company Support in Production**

In production, you'll handle multiple QuickBooks companies:
- Each customer has their own QuickBooks company
- Your app needs to store which user connects to which company
- You'll need a database to track user sessions and company IDs

### **9. Testing Production Setup**

**Before going live**:
1. Create your own QuickBooks Online account
2. Connect your production app to your account
3. Test creating invoices with real (small) amounts
4. Verify everything syncs correctly

### **10. Important Notes**

- **Real Money**: Production invoices involve actual financial transactions
- **Real Data**: You'll have access to customers' actual QuickBooks data
- **Compliance**: Ensure your app follows financial data handling regulations
- **Support**: Have customer support processes in place

## üöÄ What This App Does

This is a **QuickBooks invoice management application** with two main components:
1. **Backend (Express server)** - Handles QuickBooks OAuth authentication and invoice creation
2. **Frontend (React app)** - Provides UI for authentication, invoice creation, and customer management

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- **Server**: Express.js running on port 3001
- **Frontend**: React app running on port 3000
- **Authentication**: QuickBooks OAuth 2.0
- **Email**: Nodemailer integration for invoice delivery

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ QuickBooks authentication via OAuth
- ‚úÖ Invoice creation with email sending
- ‚úÖ Navigation between different sections
- üöß Customer management (in development)
